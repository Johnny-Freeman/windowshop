FRAMEWORK - "framework"
	General user library wrote to handle tread/process, time, object creation. Written for Python 2.7.
	
	FRAMEWORK is intented to showcase my understanding of using non-blocking methods and python imports.

DINGO - Dingo_MKII
	Old unsupported project version, originally meant to query per-second Financial data from various REST-api sources. Configurations/passwords deleted so will not work as is.
	This functioned as such: Query REST-api for JSON > parse JSON into tables > write tables to 29GB files > compress files to 3GB for storage. 
	
	DINGO is intented to showcase my understanding of REST, python thread/process management, object orientated.
	
	Newer ongoing version (not on git) is integrated into a python server built on top of memcached and postgresql, with simple load balancing.
