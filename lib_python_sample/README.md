BEAR

	Demonstrates low level socket ability. Written and deployed in REST-like envronments to allow network requests between data applications. 

FRAMEWORK - "framework"

	General user library wrote to experiment with tread/process handling. Written for Python 2.7.
	
	FRAMEWORK is depreciated and is intented to display 27 capabilities. Techniques are depreciated.

DINGO - Dingo_MKII

	Old unsupported project version, originally meant to query per-second Financial data from various REST-api sources. Configurations/passwords deleted so will not work as is.
	This functioned as such: Query REST-api for JSON > parse JSON into tables > write tables to 29GB files > compress files to 3GB for storage. 
	
	DINGO is intented to showcase my understanding of REST, python thread/process management, object orientated.
	
	Newer ongoing version (not on git) is integrated into a python server built on top of memcached and postgresql, with simple load balancing.
	
NeuralNet_Bayesian_Classes - Machine Learning Library
	
	Newer addition to Dingo_financial_data. Sets up full mathematical and neural net framework for pattern recognition. Training methods have intentionally been left out.
	
	Showcases my understanding of discrete Bayesian statistics and application to pattern recognition.
